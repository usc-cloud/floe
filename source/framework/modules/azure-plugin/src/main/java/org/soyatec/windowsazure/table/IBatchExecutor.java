 * 
 * The 2009-04-14 version of the Table service supports batch transactions on
 * entities that are in the same table and belong to the same partition group.
 * Multiple Insert Entity, Update Entity, Merge Entity, and Delete Entity
 * operations are supported within a single transaction. </p>
 * 
 * All entities subject to operations as part of the batch must have the same
 * PartitionKey value. An entity can appear only once in the transaction, and
 * only one operation may be performed against it. The transaction can include
 * at most 100 entities, and its total payload may be no more than 4 MB in size.
